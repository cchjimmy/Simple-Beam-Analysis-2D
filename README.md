# Simple-Beam-Analysis-2D
Simple Beam Analysis 2D in javascript

See GitHub Pages for an example output.

Output contains 3 diagrams in the following order:
1. Free body diagram of user defined beam
2. Shear force diagram
3. Moment diagram

# Plans
Currently it can only draw diagrams without displaying other useful information, i.e. maximum moment and shear force, data labels, axis titles, which will be implemented later.
